'''What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.

Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.

Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.

Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.

'''Most of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot 
submodule, and are usually imported under the plt alias:'''

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

xpoints = np.array([0, 6])
ypoints = np.array([0, 250])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show()
